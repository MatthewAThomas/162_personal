PintOS (CS 162 group project)
=======================

This repository contains code for PintOS - a simple, Linux-like, x86 based operating system. PintOS was developed as a group project for CS 162: Operating Systems and Systems Programming (UC Berkeley). Most of what my group and I developed is in the src/userprog and src/threads directories.
